This program uses the standard central difference approximation combined
with the the fictitious time level technique, which is analogous to the fictitious node technique, to solve the 
damped wave equation: 

u(tt) + du(t) = cu(xx) 

with boundary conditions: 

u(t, 0) = α
u(t, 1) = β

and initial conditions: 

u(0, x) = f(x)
ut(0, x) = g(x).

Where d and c are constants.
